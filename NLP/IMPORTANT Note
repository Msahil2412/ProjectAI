nltk.download('stopwords')
Stop words are words that you want to ignore, 
so you filter them out of your text when you’re processing it. 
Very common words like 'in', 'is', and 'an' are often used as stop words since they don’t add a lot of meaning to a text in and of themselves.

Content words give you information about the topics covered in the text or the sentiment that the author has about those topics.

Context words give you information about writing style. 
You can observe patterns in how authors use context words in order to quantify their writing style. 
Once you’ve quantified their writing style,
 you can analyze a text written by an unknown author to see how closely it follows a particular writing style so you can try to identify who the author is.
